    See also Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Assets for more details
    on how to define assets.

  Template
      %= asset 'app.js'

    See also Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Include for more
    details on how to include assets.

DESCRIPTION
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack is a Mojolicious plugin which can be used
    to cram multiple assets of the same type into one file. This means that
    if you have a lot of CSS files (.css, .less, .sass, ...) as input, the
    AssetPack can make one big CSS file as output. This is good, since it
    will often speed up the rendering of your page. The output file can even
    be minified, meaning you can save bandwidth and browser parsing time.

    The core preprocessors that are bundled with this module can handle CSS
    and JavaScript files, written in many languages.

MANUALS
    The documentation is split up in different manuals, for more in-depth
    information:

    *   See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Assets for how to define
        assets in your application.

    *   See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Include for how to
        include the assets in the template.

    *   See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Modes for how AssetPack
        behaves in different modes.

    *   See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::CustomDomain for how to
        serve your assets from a custom host.

    *   See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors for details on the
        different (official) preprocessors.

ENVIRONMENT
  MOJO_ASSETPACK_DEBUG
    Set this to get extra debug information to STDERR from AssetPack
    internals.

  MOJO_ASSETPACK_NO_CACHE
    If true, convert the assets each time they're expanded, instead of once
    at application start (useful for development).

HELPERS
  asset
    This plugin defined the helper "asset()". This helper can be called in
    different ways:

    *   $self = $c->asset;

        This will return the plugin instance, that you can call methods on.

    *   $c->asset($moniker => @real_files);

        See "add".

    *   $bytestream = $c->asset($moniker, \%args, @attr);

        Used to include an asset in a template.

ATTRIBUTES
  base_url
      $app->plugin("AssetPack" => {base_url => "/packed/"});
      $str = $self->base_url;

    This attribute can be used to control where to serve static assets from.

    Defaults value is "/packed/".

    See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::CustomDomain for more
    details.

    NOTE! You need to have a trailing "/" at the end of the string.

  minify
      $app->plugin("AssetPack" => {minify => $bool});
      $bool = $self->minify;

    Set this to true if the assets should be minified.

    Default is false in "development" mode and true otherwise.

    See also Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Modes.

  preprocessors
      $obj = $self->preprocessors;

    Holds a Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Preprocessors object.

METHODS
  add
      $self->add($moniker => @real_files);

    Used to define assets.

    See Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Assets for mode details.

  fetch
      $path = $self->fetch($url);

    This method can be used to fetch an asset and store the content to a
    local file. The download will be skipped if the file already exists. The
    return value is the absolute path to the downloaded file.

  get
      @files = $self->get($moniker);

    Returns a list of files which the moniker point to. The list will only
    contain one file if "minify" is true.

    See "Full control" in Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Include
    for mode details.

  headers
      $app->plugin("AssetPack" => {headers => {"Cache-Control" => "max-age=31536000"}});
      $app->asset->headers({"Cache-Control" => "max-age=31536000"});

    Calling this method will add a after_static hook which will set
    additional response headers when an asset is served.

  out_dir
      $app->plugin("AssetPack" => {out_dir => $str});
      $str = $self->out_dir;

    Returns the path to the directory where generated packed files are
    located.

    Changing this from the default will probably lead to inconsistency.
    Please report back if you are using this feature with success.

  purge
      $self = $self->purge({always => $bool});

    Used to purge old packed files. This is useful if you want to avoid
    filling up "out_dir" with many versions of the packed file.

    "always" default to true if in "development" mode and false otherwise.

    This method is EXPERIMENTAL.

  register
      plugin AssetPack => {
        base_url     => $str,     # default to "/packed"
        headers      => {"Cache-Control" => "max-age=31536000"},
        minify       => $bool,    # compress assets
        proxy        => "detect", # autodetect proxy settings
        out_dir      => "/path/to/some/directory",
        source_paths => [...],
      };

    Will register the "asset" helper. All arguments are optional.

  source_paths
      $self = $self->source_paths($array_ref);
      $array_ref = $self->source_paths;

    This method returns a list of paths to source files. The default is to
    return "paths" in Mojolicious::Static from the current application
    object, but you can specify your own paths.

    See also "Custom source directories" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Assets for more information.

  test_app
      Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack->test_app("MyApp");

    This method will create two Mojo::Test instances of "MyApp" and create
    assets with "minify" set to 0 and 1. "SHIPPING" in
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AssetPack::Manual::Cookbook for more details.

    This method is EXPERIMENTAL.
